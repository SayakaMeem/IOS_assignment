Tic Tac Toe Game in SwiftUI
This repository contains a simple implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game using SwiftUI. The game allows two players to take turns placing their symbols on a 3x3 grid, with the goal of getting three in a row.
Features
Two-player gameplay: Players alternate turns, represented by "X" and "O".
Dynamic board: The game board updates in real-time as players make their moves.
Winner detection: The game checks for a winner after each move and displays the result.
ContentView Struct
The ContentView struct defines the user interface:
Displays the current player and game board.
Uses buttons for each cell on the board to allow players to make moves.
Shows the winner when one is detected.

#Usage :
Launch the app on your simulator or device.
Players will take turns tapping on empty cells to place their symbols.
The game will announce a winner when one player successfully places three symbols in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.


#Technologies Used :

Language: Swift
Framework: SwiftUI
